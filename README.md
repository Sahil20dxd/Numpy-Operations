Banknote Authentication - NumPy Operations

This project demonstrates the use of NumPy for basic matrix operations, statistics, and data handling using a Banknote Authentication dataset (banknote_data.csv).

It is built as part of an assignment to show practical applications of NumPy functions on real-world data.
Files

    Assignment_1.py — Python script performing NumPy operations on the dataset.

    banknote_data.csv — CSV file containing data about banknotes, including features like variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy.

Project Objective

The main goal is to:

    Load a dataset using NumPy

    Perform basic operations like mean, standard deviation, matrix multiplication, transpose, and more

    Extract useful statistics from the data

It serves as a basic example of data preprocessing and manipulation using only NumPy, without using higher-level libraries like pandas.
